cognitive function**

## introduction

- Recent reports state that dementia in its early and
pre-symptomatic stages including MCI, present not only with
memory disorder but also motor and sensory dysfunction. `Kouzuki M, Suzuki T, Nagano M, Nakamura S, Katsumata Y,
Takamura A, Urakami K. Comparison of olfactory and gustatory
disorders in Alzheimer’s disease. Neurol Sci 2018; 39: 321–8.`
- Previous studies on finger function
in dementia patients reported declined fine motor control and
dexterity of the fingers and fewer finger tapping movements. `Kluger A, Gianutsos JG, Golomb J, Ferris SH, George AE, Franssen E, Reisberg B. Patterns of motor impairement in normal aging,
mild cognitive decline, and early Alzheimer’s disease. J Gerontol B
Psychol Sci Soc Sci 1997; 52B: 28–39. Tomita Y, Tanaka S, Takahashi S, Takeuchi N. Detecting cognitive
decline in community-dwelling older adults using simple cognitive
and motor performance tests. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2020; 20: 212–7. Yan JH, Dick MB. Practice effects on motor control in healthy seniors
and patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.

- A decrease in finger tapping velocity was also reported by Muller in mild AD patients and Ott in mild to moderate AD
patients, respectively. // ` Muller G, Weisbrod S, Klingberg F. Finger tapping frequency
and accuracy are decreased in early stage primary degenerative
dementia. Dementia 1991; 2: 169–72. Ott BR, Ellias SA, Lannon MC. Quantitative assessment of
movement in Alzheimer’s disease. J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1995;
8: 71–5.`
- indicating that the parameters related to contact time are highly likely to be one of the parameters
significantly associated with the cognitive function of patients
with dementia.

- distance rate of velocity peak in extending
movement (No. 17) tended to be high, it was suggested that
those with low MMSE scores may have an inconsistent distance
to reach maximum speed, leading to an unstable finger extension
movement.

- However, diagnostic
imaging based on these advanced technologies has challenges,
such as financial and physical burdens on the subject and the time required for measurement and analysis.
